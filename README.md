# LoremType

LoremType is a program made in C that runs in a terminal, the default theme is Catppuccin Mocha but it is easily replaceable from the C file simply by searching for the colors and substituting (it is explained within the code). Sorry if the code is an amorphous ball, it's my first C program :')


## Installation

To install this program is very simple and there is only one dependency, `ncurses` and `git`, depending on your system, you will have to install it one way or another, investigate it before installing.

Then you must enter the following commands

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Alexxami/LoremType.git
  cd LoremType
  gcc -o LoremType LoremType.c -lncurses
  sudo chmod +x LoremType
  sudo mv LoremType /bin     
```

## Execute

```bash
    LoremType
```
